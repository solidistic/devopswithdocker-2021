# Updating an old project

I decided to dockerize one of my very first fullstack projects. It uses React in the frontend and Express.js in the backend with MongoDB. I have always used Docker run MongoDB in a container, but really didn't have the skills to implement full development environment with it. I didnt' implement redis and nginx for now. 

Before any changes I had backend and React in the same root folder. I moved backend to its own folder and React project to frontend folder with separate `package.json` files. For both backend and frontend I created Dockerfiles. Docker compose file was created to root of the project. 

First I encountered couple of issues with used npm libraries:

- My local `node_modules` was copied to container and cause some conficts
- Nodemon wasn't found from `node_modules` so I installed it globally in the backend container
- [Sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) required python and I had to download and install required packages (python & build-essentials)

I created one network which connected all three services. Volumes were created for every service to update changes instantly to the container.
