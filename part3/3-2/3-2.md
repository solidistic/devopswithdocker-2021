## 3.2

In this task I created new repo https://github.com/solidistic/devops-3-2 which the image in docker-compose.yaml is based on. First I really had trouble finding out what needs to be done in this task. I created Actions into devops-3-2 repo and didn't think that was the way to do this. After all the attempts I created one shell script `pull-push.sh` which runs `docker-compose up -d` and then pushes the downloaded repo to DockerHub.

Hopefully this solution was what the task was about...

DockerHub repo can be found https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/solidistic/devops-3-2
